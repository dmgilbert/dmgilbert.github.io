Over the past week I've been tinkering around with a few smaller things, brewing up some fermented products and making a chopping board. This all started when I noticed the raw honey collected from my dad's beehive had started to ferment a little, so I quickly rushed to think of ways to use this honey before it was wasted. With roughly 5kg of the stuff, I got to work starting the fermentation process, making two batches of mead as well as garlic, strawberries and blueberries (from left to right). The bottle on the far right is Kvass, a slightly alcoholic fermented drink made from burnt bread and raisins.

__Using up the Honey:__
Making mead with raw honey has been in the back of my mind for a while, but this situation provided the catalytic push to get started. After some research, I found a $30 brewing kit and some suitable winemaker's yeast on ebay would be good enough to get started, so I ordered these and prepared the other fermented things in the meantime. The strawberry and blueberry fermentation took about a week, I simply sanatised the jars in the oven for 5mins at 140&#176; and placed the fruit in the jars with the honey. After about a week, the fruit had an effervescence about it and the taste had definetly changed and was quite tasty when paired with some homemade pannacotta. The garlic honey is still fermenting, apparently taking about a month or two but it seems to be working as the garlic is becoming increasingly pungent.
