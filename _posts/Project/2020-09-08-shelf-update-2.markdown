Letting the prototype sit on my desk for a couple days, a few ideas came to mind. I really wasn't happy with the wonky flanges but i did quite like having the supports closer to the center of my desk, this kept the space feeling nice and open, also allowing my laptop/books to sit on the corners of my desk. To deal with the support problem I went online and ordered some aluminium flanges; this way I could work the parts back into shape if they were also bent. So thus began the waiting game.

Just before the flanges were due to arrive, I went back to the hardware store to pick out some material for the shelf. I wanted a darker acacia wood shelf, but as they were out of stock I ended up buying a 1800&times;405&times;18 mm laminated merbau panel, which I could stain darker if needed. However, the colour grew on me and I've decided to leave it as is for now, Maybe giving it a simple oil or beeswax coating in the future. I got this panel cut down, and one of the off cuts is the perfect size for a chopping board, a mini project I may do soon.

When the flanges finally arrived, it was very relieving to see they were nice and straight, not perfect but definitely good enough. I then set up the shelf with the supports on either side, but this just looked 'off' to me, so I decided to keep the supports closer to the center of the desk. This also reduced the maximum bending moment in the shelf, meaning it could now hold more weight. I then screwed the flanges onto the wooden panel and set up the new shelf atop my desk, and I think it looks great! I've still got to paint the steel pipe section and give the wood a nice finish but I am very pleased with how this project has turned out so far.
