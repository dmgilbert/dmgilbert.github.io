Letting the prototype sit on my desk for a couple days, a few ideas came to mind. I really wasn't happy with the wonky flanges but i did quite like having the supports closer to the center of my desk, this kept the space feeling nice and open, also allowing my laptop/books to sit on the corners of my desk. To deal with the support problem I went online and ordered some aluminium flanges; this way I could work the parts back into shape if they were also bent. So thus began the waiting game...
