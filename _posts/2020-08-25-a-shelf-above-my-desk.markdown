My room is currently rather boring, so I want to make a 120-150mm shelf to go above my desk, holding a few large books, art prints and other decorations to make my room less of a quarantine prison cell. I want the shelf to be around 600mm above my desk but it needs to be at least 530mm to clear my monitors and ideally have at least a 50mm gap between the top of the monitors and the shelf. I'd like the shelf to rest up against the wall, but because I'm renting I can't damage the wall in any way. I'd also like to keep as much desk space as possible and also keep the space nice and open so I can pretend I'm free and not trapped working at my desk all day.

__Constraints:__

- Can&#39;t drill or otherwise damage the wall
- Want to avoid taking up desk space
- Only an angle grinder and drill for cutting metal, no welder
- $150 budget

<br/>

__Designs:__

<ins> Fully floating shelf </ins>

- Saves desk space, doesn&#39;t require any metal working, aesthetically pleasing, easy to adjust to required dimensions
- No drilling into the wall makes it very difficult to support the required load of the shelf and objects upon it, wall protective adhesive is expensive and can&#39;t hold much more than 3kg

<ins> Trapezium steel frame supports mounted to desk </ins>

- Would easily support the load, more aesthetically pleasing than a rectangular frame
- Lack of metal working tools means an expensive custom frame would be required, takes up larger amounts of desk space, creates a more &#39;closed in/cramped&#39; space, may require a require a more rigid shelf to avoid sagging in the centre

<ins> Steel pipe supports on either end</ins>

- Takes up minimal desk space, steel pipes match the round steel monitor stand already on the desk, supports the required load, simpler/cheaper to construct than other designs
- Still takes up some desk space, limited by only 550mm pipe being available so some risers would be necessary, may require a require a more rigid shelf to avoid sagging in the centre
