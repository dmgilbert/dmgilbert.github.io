After almost a year of weekly games, my group and I finally finished this fantastically murderous campaign (R.I.P. to the 7 dead player characters). I had a great time taking my players through the crazy island of Chult and I hope they did too! Just note there are big spoilers for the ToA finale, so beware...

<br/>

__Welcome to the Jungle__

Starting my players off at level 3, the group was contracted to find and map the way to the lost city of Omu, where an evil device preventing ressurection was believed to be located. The party set off down the river Soshenstar, onto which I had moved Firefinger and Dungrunglung (described in the ToA book) to break up the boring journey. We had a lot of fun playing around with zombies, dinosaurs and of course zombie dinosaurs on the way, giving the jungle a bit more identity. The players eventually reached the Heart of Ubtao, into which I moved Saja N'Baza (from Orolunga) to provide the players some lore and direct them over to the Aarakockra settlement of Kir Sabal, where they could find a way to the lost city Omu. Heading deeper into undead territory the party kept hearing ominous stomping noises each night, before fighting the "Z-Rex" (a zombie tyrannosaurus). From Kir Sabal the party went on a side quest to Nangalore, before spending a few days flying south west towards Omu. Just before reaching Omu, the party found themselves facing Tinder(the red dragon from Wyrmheart mine), unfortunately leading to the deaths of one of the characters just before they reached their goal.

__Snake City__

Reaching Omu, the party met a defecting Red Wizard who replaced the fallen character and started to learn about the two other forces, the Yuan'ti snake people and the Red Wizards, acting in the city. Stumbling through a few shrines to some of the nine gods of Omu, the whole party was brought low by the clay __Gladiators__ in Shagambi's shrine after some... questionable decisions made by the players. We now had to bring in the B-team: a group of pirates who were cursed by another captain, forcing them to go to Omu and raid the Tomb of the Nine Gods within Omu. This group found the corpses of the last group, piecing together that the special cubes in each god's shrine were needed to open the tomb they were looking for. Unfortunately, the Red Wizards had a couple puzzle cubes and the Yuan'ti had one as well, so the players formed an uneasy alliance with the Red Wizards- agreeing to help steal the last puzzle cube from the Yuan'ti and open the tomb together. This then lead the players into the Fane of the Night Serpent.

__Attempted Espionage__

Either using disguise self to appear as Yuan'ti or turning invisible, the party snuck into the Yuan'ti palace, taking with them a red wizard who they pretended was their prisoner. This got them through the gate, but they didn't have any plan after that; this ended up costing them dearly. One of the players found a strange looking arcane circle, stepping on it took them to the throne room, where they stole a spellbook and set off a temple wide alarm. Trying desperately to hide, one of the Yuan'ti priestesses, Fenthaza, hid the party away and offered to help them escape if they helped her stage a coup to instate her as the leader of the Yuan'ti. The players, with not much other choice, agreed and Fenthaza offered to turn the players into Yuan'ti, making them stronger but at the cost of their humanity and sanity. A few players agreed, with two of them gaining an indefinite madness effect and one getting away scot-free. As the coup began and Yuan'ti infighting broke out, the players snuck back into the throne room and challenged Ras Nsi, the current leader, and brought him down to his last breath. While this happened, a demon summoned by a player went beserk, and Ras Nsi took this opportunity to bargain for his life with the knowledge of a secret tunnel. The players, being exhausted and depleted from the fight, agreed; sneaking out with the required puzzle cube as Ras Nsi warned them of a false entrance to the tomb.

__The Tomb of Horrors__

Rendezvousing with the Red Wizards at the tomb entrance, the players handed over the puzzle cubes and watched as the Red Wizards attempted to enter the tomb, taking the false entrance and all dying to a trap. The players were a little rattled, but managed to find the true entrance and begin their deadly trudge through the dungeon. The first few floors were cleared with relative ease, the players discovering that each floor had a prismatic skeleton key, a triangular prism on the first floor, a rectangular one on the next, and assumed correctly that these keys might be important later on. They also found tombs to some of the gods of Omu, with a couple players taking magical items from the tomb and being possesed by the ghosts of the dead gods. From this possession they learnt that a lich, Acererack, killed the gods and built a tomb here to hide away his possessions. On the third floor, the players kept seeing weird alien moss and kept finding eye shaped crystals, leading them into a Beholder's lair. Here they had a rather insane combat, fighting an invisible beholder in a frictionless room, and came out mostly on top- losing one player to the Beholder's petrification beam. Resting after the fight, Acererack stoppped by to taunt the players, stealing the petrified player and driving the rest of the party to head deeper. The party gained another member on the next floor, freeing a druid trapped inside a mirror and continuing on deeper together.
