After almost a year of weekly games, my group and I finally finished this fantastically murderous campaign (R.I.P. to the 7 dead player characters). I had a great time taking my players through the crazy island of Chult and I hope they did too! Just note there are big spoilers for the ToA finale, so beware...

__Welcome to the jungle__
Starting my players off at level 3, the group was contracted to find and map the way to the lost city of Omu, where an evil device preventing ressurection was believed to be located. The party set off down the river Soshenstar, onto which I had moved Firefinger and Dungrunglung (described in the ToA book) to break up the boring journey. We had a lot of fun playing around with zombies, dinosaurs and of course zombie dinosaurs on the way, giving the jungle a bit more identity. The players eventually reached the Heart of Ubtao, into which I moved Saja N'Baza (from Orolunga) to provide the players some lore and direct them over to the Aarakockra settlement of Kir Sabal, where they could find a way to the lost city Omu. Heading deeper into undead territory the party kept hearing ominous stomping noises each night, before fighting the "Z-Rex" (a zombie tyrannosaurus). From Kir Sabal the party went on a side quest to Nangalore, before flying down to the "Peaks of Flame" (mountains in the south).
