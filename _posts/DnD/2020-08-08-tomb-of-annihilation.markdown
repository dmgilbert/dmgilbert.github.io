After almost a year of weekly games, my group and I finally finished this fantastically murderous campaign (R.I.P. to the 7 dead player characters). I had a great time taking my players through the crazy island of Chult and I hope they did too! Just note there are big spoilers for the ToA finale, so beware...

__Welcome to the Jungle__

Starting my players off at level 3, the group was contracted to find and map the way to the lost city of Omu, where an evil device preventing ressurection was believed to be located. The party set off down the river Soshenstar, onto which I had moved Firefinger and Dungrunglung (described in the ToA book) to break up the boring journey. We had a lot of fun playing around with zombies, dinosaurs and of course zombie dinosaurs on the way, giving the jungle a bit more identity. The players eventually reached the Heart of Ubtao, into which I moved Saja N'Baza (from Orolunga) to provide the players some lore and direct them over to the Aarakockra settlement of Kir Sabal, where they could find a way to the lost city Omu. Heading deeper into undead territory the party kept hearing ominous stomping noises each night, before fighting the "Z-Rex" (a zombie tyrannosaurus). From Kir Sabal the party went on a side quest to Nangalore, before spending a few days flying south west towards Omu. Just before reaching Omu, the party found themselves facing Tinder(the red dragon from Wyrmheart mine), unfortunately leading to the deaths of one of the characters just before they reached their goal.

__Snake City__
Reaching Omu, the party met a defecting Red Wizard who replaced the fallen character and started to learn about the two other forces, the Yuan'ti snake people and the Red Wizards, acting in the city. Stumbling through a few shrines to some of the nine gods of Omu, the whole party was brought low by the clay __Gladiators__ in Shagambi's shrine after some... questionable decisions made by the players. We now had to bring in the B-team: a group of pirates who were cursed by another captain, forcing them to go to Omu and raid the Tomb of the Nine Gods within Omu. This group found the corpses of the last group, piecing together that the special cubes in each god's shrine were needed to open the tomb they were looking for. Unfortunately, the Red Wizards had a couple puzzle cubes and the Yuan'ti had one as well, so the players formed an uneasy alliance with the Red Wizards- agreeing to help steal the last puzzle cube from the Yuan'ti and open the tomb together. This then lead the players into the Fane of the Night Serpent.
